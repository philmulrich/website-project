        <h1>Hello, I'm Phil.</h1>
        <p>I am a High School student living in Colorado Springs, CO.</p>
        <p>
          I have many interests, maybe to many... First of all, I love anything that has anything to do with
          space. I love astronomy, satellite tracking and comminication, GPS, manned missions, and pushing the
          limits beyond our atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also find communications of any kind interesting. Something about formatting and conveying essential
          information has always caught my attention. Mainly, I've focused on radio transmissions. I love reading
          about how certain transmissions are encoded, transmitted, propogate, and how they are ultimatley recieved.
          As a licensed radio operator, I have the priveledge of transmitting on certain frequencies to communicate
          with others who share my same status, or to study the propogration and reception of signals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I enjoy developing programs. My expertise (strong word) is in Java, but I also have experience
          programming in Python, MatLab, JavaScript, and a C/C++ dialect. This website in particular was coded in HTML and
          CSS, so I'll let you be the judge of my skills with those languages. Spoiler Alert: Not very skilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          To summarize, I have a good amout of technical interests. Because of this, I often find myself on random projects
          every month, from radio to astronomy to coding to radio astromomy that leverages programming. To see what I've been
          up to, take a look at my projects page. And if it interests you, take a look at my resume.

          Thank you for visting my website.

        <p>Best,</p>
